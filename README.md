# Revenge

The carcass of a text adventure game I started in the 1990s. It shows its age.

I have a stack of notes mapping out the unwritten parts of the game. I may
scan them and put them here, or I may even use them to write more code.  It's
hard to imagine it ever being finished.

It is written in Inform 5.
